# How to use `git` and Github to collaborate.
1. Make sure you have git installed on your computer. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows
2. Download a Github client. I use the terminal, but if you want a visual interface I recommend Gitkraken[https://www.gitkraken.com/] or Github Desktop[https://desktop.github.com/].
3. First thing you'll want to do is `clone` the repository from the Github website. In your browser, with the repo open, click the green `Clone or Download` button, and copy the link from the textbox. Going back to your git client (either the GUI or terminal), `clone` the repo. In the GUI, find where to import an existing repo, and use the URL from the same place to `clone` the repo to your computer.
4. Now that the repo is on your machine, you can load up the file in Unity. However, before you start working on the project you'll need to create a `branch` to separate your edits from the main code, so that any changes you make can be tracked and undone if anything breaks. In your GUI, find the `Create Branch` button (or something similar), and name your branch with your name in it. I suggest we use the naming scheme `yourinitialshere-develop`. So, in my case it would be `jpt-develop`. Once you've got this set up, you can begin working and `git` will work its magic in the background and track all your changes.
5. Once you're ready to submit your work - which you should do anytime you're walking away from your computer or taking a break - you should `commit` your work.
